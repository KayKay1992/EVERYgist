Creating Axios Instance and uploadImage functionality

## Axios Instance and uploadImage — Implementation Explanation

Overview
- You created a reusable Axios instance for frontend HTTP requests and a small utility to upload images to the backend. Centralizing Axios configuration keeps headers, base URL, and interceptors consistent across the app.

Files involved
- `frontend/gist_hub/src/utils/axioInstance.js` (or similarly named) — Axios instance configuration
- `frontend/gist_hub/src/utils/uploadImage.js` — helper that uploads images with multipart/form-data

Axios instance (what it does)
- Sets `BASE_URL` to `http://localhost:8000` so all requests are relative to your backend.
- Applies default headers such as `Content-Type: application/json` for normal requests.
- Optionally attaches an Authorization header from localStorage (or user context) so protected routes use the JWT automatically.
- Adds response/request interceptors for centralized error handling (e.g., auto-logout on 401) and to show loading indicators if desired.

uploadImage utility (how it works)
- Accepts a File object (from an `<input type="file">`), builds a `FormData` instance, and appends the file under the expected key, for example `image`.
- Uses the Axios instance to POST the form to `BASE_URL + API_PATHS.IMAGE.UPLOAD_IMAGE` (`/api/auth/upload-image`).
- Sets the request header `Content-Type` to `multipart/form-data`; when using Axios with FormData, you can let Axios set the boundary automatically by not specifying a content-type or using `headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' }`.
- On success, the backend returns the uploaded image URL/path; the utility resolves with that URL so calling components can save it to user profile or include it in a post.

Example usage in a component
1. User selects a file via a file input.
2. Component calls `const imageUrl = await uploadImage(file);`
3. On success, update the user profile or include `imageUrl` in the request body for creating/updating a post.

Error handling and UX
- The utility catches Axios errors and returns a helpful message (network error, file too large, unsupported type).
- The frontend should show feedback (toast/snackbar) for success or failure.

Security and best practices
- Validate file type and size client-side before sending (e.g., allow images only, limit to a few MB).
- Keep the upload endpoint protected (only authenticated users can upload profile images).
- Serve uploaded files from a static `/uploads` route on the backend and store only the path/URL in DB.

Why this helps
- Centralized Axios + upload helper reduces duplication and mistakes.
- Makes adding auth headers and global error handling trivial.
- Simplifies components: they only call `uploadImage` and receive a URL back.

Next steps (optional)
- Add a progress indicator by using Axios `onUploadProgress` to show upload percentage.
- Add client-side image resizing/compression to save bandwidth.
- Add server-side validation and virus scanning for uploaded files.
