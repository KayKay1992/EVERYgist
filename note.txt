Creating userContext 

## User Context (Auth) and Admin Login — Implementation Explanation

User Context (`frontend/gist_hub/src/context/userContext.jsx`)
- Purpose: Provide a global, React Context–based auth state so any component can read the current user, loading state, and call login/logout helpers without prop drilling.

What it stores
- `user`: the authenticated user object (null if not logged in)
- `loading`: true while checking stored token and fetching the profile
- `openAuthForm`: UI flag for toggling an auth modal/sheet

How it initializes (auto-login)
- On mount, it looks for a `token` in `localStorage`.
- If found, it calls `GET /api/auth/profile` using the shared Axios instance (`axiosInstance`) and `API_PATHS.AUTH.GET_PROFILE`.
- On success, it sets `user` with the response and flips `loading` to false.
- If no token or the request fails, it stops loading and leaves `user` as null.

Helpers exposed
- `updateUser(userData)`: saves the user object to state and persists `userData.token` to `localStorage` (enables subsequent authenticated calls).
- `clearUser()`: clears `user`, removes the token from `localStorage` (logs out). Note: there is a stray `setSearchResults([])` call that isn’t defined in this file—safe to remove or wire it to actual search state.
- `openAuthForm` / `setOpenAuthForm`: lets the UI open/close auth UI.

How other components use it
- Wrap your app in `<UserProvider>` (usually in `main.jsx` or at the root of `App.jsx`).
- Inside components, use `const { user, loading, updateUser, clearUser } = useContext(UserContext);`
- After a successful login/register response, call `updateUser({ ...response.data, token })` to store the token and user, then navigate to protected screens.

Integration details
- Requests go through your `axiosInstance`, which centralizes `BASE_URL`, headers, and any interceptors (e.g., attaching `Authorization: Bearer <token>`). That’s why fetching `/api/auth/profile` works automatically once the token is saved.

Admin Login Page (`frontend/gist_hub/src/pages/Admin/AdminLogin.jsx`)
- Purpose: Simple auth screen that switches between Login and SignUp views.
- UI structure:
	- Header bar with logo.
	- Centered card that conditionally renders either `<Login />` or `<SignUp />` based on `currentPage`.
- State flow:
	- `currentPage` state toggles between `'login'` and `'signup'`.
	- The setter `setCurrentPage` is passed to the child forms so they can switch views (e.g., “Don’t have an account? Sign up”).

How this ties together
- The Login/SignUp forms (in `components/Auth/`) should call the backend:
	- Login → `POST /api/auth/login`
	- Register → `POST /api/auth/register`
- On success, they should call `updateUser` from `UserContext` with the returned token and user.
- After `updateUser`, redirect to the admin dashboard page.

Notes and quick fixes
- Remove or define `setSearchResults([])` inside `clearUser` to avoid runtime errors.
- Ensure `<Login />` and `<SignUp />` are imported in `AdminLogin.jsx` and accept `setCurrentPage` as a prop.
- If protected admin routes are used, gate them with a PrivateRoute that reads `user` from `UserContext`.

Optional enhancements
- Add an Axios response interceptor to auto-logout on 401 and call `clearUser()`.
- Persist `user` (not just token) in storage to avoid a profile fetch on every reload, or implement a light cache with revalidation.
- Use a refresh token flow for longer sessions and better security.
