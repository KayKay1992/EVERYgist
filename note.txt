Dynamic Time-Based Greeting Implementation

## Dynamic Greeting Feature — Implementation Explanation

### Overview
Replaced the static "Good morning!" greeting with a dynamic greeting that changes based on the current time of day, providing a more personalized and contextually relevant user experience.

### What Changed

**File Modified**
- `frontend/gist_hub/src/pages/Admin/Dashboard.jsx`

### Implementation Details

**Step 1: Created Helper Function**
Added `getTimeBasedGreeting()` function inside the Dashboard component:

```javascript
const getTimeBasedGreeting = () => {
  const currentHour = new Date().getHours();
  
  if (currentHour >= 5 && currentHour < 12) {
    return "Good morning";
  } else if (currentHour >= 12 && currentHour < 17) {
    return "Good afternoon";
  } else if (currentHour >= 17 && currentHour < 21) {
    return "Good evening";
  } else {
    return "Good night";
  }
};
```

**Logic Breakdown:**
- Gets current hour (0-23) using `new Date().getHours()`
- Returns greeting based on time ranges:
  - **5:00 AM - 11:59 AM** → "Good morning"
  - **12:00 PM - 4:59 PM** → "Good afternoon"
  - **5:00 PM - 8:59 PM** → "Good evening"
  - **9:00 PM - 4:59 AM** → "Good night"

**Step 2: Updated JSX**
Changed the greeting from static to dynamic:

```jsx
// Before:
<h2>Good morning! {user?.name}</h2>

// After:
<h2>{getTimeBasedGreeting()}! {user?.name}</h2>
```

### How It Works

1. When Dashboard component renders, `getTimeBasedGreeting()` is called
2. Function gets current system time and extracts the hour
3. Based on hour, appropriate greeting is returned
4. Greeting is interpolated into the JSX with user's name
5. User sees contextually appropriate message (e.g., "Good evening! John")

### Time Ranges Explained

- **Morning (5 AM - 12 PM)**: Early risers and morning hours
- **Afternoon (12 PM - 5 PM)**: Post-lunch and business hours
- **Evening (5 PM - 9 PM)**: After work, dinner time
- **Night (9 PM - 5 AM)**: Late night and overnight

### Benefits

✅ **Personalized UX**: Feels more natural and attentive to user's context
✅ **No External Dependencies**: Uses native JavaScript Date API
✅ **Automatic Updates**: Updates when page refreshes or user navigates back
✅ **Simple Logic**: Easy to understand and maintain
✅ **Lightweight**: No performance impact

### Example Outputs

- Visit at 8:00 AM → "Good morning! Sarah"
- Visit at 2:30 PM → "Good afternoon! Sarah"
- Visit at 6:00 PM → "Good evening! Sarah"
- Visit at 11:00 PM → "Good night! Sarah"

### Possible Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: Use `setInterval` to update greeting every minute without refresh
2. **Timezone Awareness**: Use user's timezone instead of system time
3. **Custom Messages**: Add more variety (e.g., "Happy Friday!" on Fridays)
4. **Weather Integration**: "Good morning! It's sunny outside" with weather API
5. **Locale Support**: Translate greetings based on user's language preference
6. **Special Occasions**: "Happy Birthday!" on user's birthday from profile data

### Code Location

- Function defined: Inside `Dashboard` component, before `getDashboardData`
- Usage: Line ~49 in the greeting heading JSX
