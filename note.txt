MongoDB Connection Setup – Files Changed and Explanation
Generated: October 31, 2025
===============================================================================

1) backend/.env
----------------
- MONGO_URI set to a valid MongoDB Atlas SRV connection string:
	- Password special character '@' is URL-encoded as '%40'.
	- Target database set to 'everygist'.
	- Added standard options: retryWrites=true, w=majority, appName=GistHub.
- PORT updated to 5000 (server listens on this port).

Why: The previous URI failed DNS/SRV resolution due to an unencoded '@' in the password and a malformed host segment. Encoding and correcting the URI fixed ENOTFOUND.

2) backend/config/db.js
-----------------------
- Reads MONGO_URI from the environment and exits early if missing.
- Uses mongoose.connect(uri, { serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 5000 }) to fail fast when cluster is unreachable.
- Logs a clear success message on connection.
- On error, prints the message and a helpful hint if ENOTFOUND occurs (typically a bad host or unencoded credentials), then exits the process.

Why: Adds resilience and clearer diagnostics for common connection issues.

3) backend/server.js
--------------------
- Loads environment variables with dotenv.
- Initializes an Express app and configures CORS (open origin for now; adjust for production).
- Calls connectDB() to establish the MongoDB connection before handling requests.
- Parses JSON request bodies with express.json().
- Serves '/uploads' as a static directory.
- Starts the HTTP server using PORT from .env (defaults to 5000 if unset).
- Route imports are scaffolded (commented) and ready to be enabled when implemented.

Why: Provides a clean startup sequence (env → DB → middleware → routes → server) and a predictable development port.

Verification
------------
- Running the dev server shows:
	- "Server started on port 5000"
	- "MongoDB connected successfully"
- Confirms the connection string and startup pipeline are working.

Next Suggestions (optional)
---------------------------
- Restrict CORS origins to your frontend domain(s).
- Add a health endpoint (GET /health) that returns DB status.
- Enable route files and add basic 404/error handlers.
- In db.js, optionally log the connected host/db for visibility.
