Perfect! Now let me configure your frontend to connect to your deployed backend:

Read apiPaths.js, lines 1 to 10

Good! The API paths are already configured to use environment variables. Now let me create the production environment file:

Created .env.production

Created .env.local

Now let me update the backend CORS and FRONTEND_URL settings:

Read server.js, lines 26 to 35

Perfect! The CORS is already set to allow all origins, which will work for now. Let me create a quick deployment guide for your frontend:

Created FRONTEND_DEPLOYMENT.md

Perfect! Now let me create the gitignore files to ensure sensitive data isn't committed:

Created .gitignore

Created .gitignore

Excellent! Everything is configured. Here's what to do next:

✅ Frontend Configuration Complete!
What I Did:
✅ Created .env.production with your backend URL
✅ Created .env.local for local development
✅ Created .gitignore files to protect sensitive data
✅ Created FRONTEND_DEPLOYMENT.md with step-by-step instructions
🚀 Next: Deploy Frontend (3 Simple Steps)
